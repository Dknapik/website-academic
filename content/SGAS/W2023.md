# 2023 Winter
Instead of having invited speakers give talks on their own research, the format for the Winter 2023 semester consisted of meetings where students gave lectures on a few topics (one topic per person) in order to provide the background information needed for those interested in pursuing research in the fields of geometry and analysis. Thank you to everyone who participated.
