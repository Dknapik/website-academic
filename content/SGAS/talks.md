**November 17: Damien Tageddine (McGill University)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Noncommutative differential geometry on infinitesimal spaces*</span><br>
Noncommutative differential geometry is a most prominent realization of noncommutative geometry. In this talk, we will show how the noncommutative analogue of spin
geometry in terms of generalized Dirac operators $D$ acting on a representation space of an algebra $A$ can extend classical differential geometry to nonmanifold like spaces. We start with a brief review of inverse limit of posets as an approximation of a topological space. We then show how to associate a $C*$-algebra over a poset,
giving it a piecewise-linear structure. Furthermore, we explain how dually the algebra of continuous function $C(M)$ over a manifold $M$ can
be approximated by a direct limit of $C*$-algebras over posets. Finally, we prove how classical differential calculus is recovered as the spectrum of the commutator with a Dirac operator.

<span style="color:red">*SU(2) representations of small Dehn surgeries on knots*</span><br>
Kronheimer-Mrowka proved that the fundamental group of r-surgery on a nontrivial knot for |r|<=2 always has an irreducible SU(2) representation, which answered the property P conjecture affirmly. They asked the case of r=3 and 4. The case r=4 was solved by Baldwin-Sivek and the case r=3 was solved by Baldwin-Li-Sivek-Ye. In this talk, I will describe the strategy of the proofs using instanton Floer homology.

**October 25: Gabriel Rioux (Cornell University)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Aspects of Ricci curvature bounds on metric measure spaces*</span><br>
This talk aims to highlight the role that optimal transport, information theory, and gradient flows have played in the study of geometry in metric measure spaces. To this effect, the seminal work of J. Lott, C. Villani, and K.-T. Sturm on extending the standard curvature-dimensions conditions on Riemannian manifolds to general metric measure spaces will be reviewed and some extensions of this work will be discussed.

The driving force behind these developments is the interplay between the geometry of the optimal transport of probability measures on a metric measure space $(\mathcal X, d, \mu)$ and the geometric properties of $(\mathcal X, d, \mu)$, especially as it pertains to the properties of information functionals along geodesics in the space of probabilities.

If time permits, an application of this theory to the construction of heat flows in nonsmooth spaces will be provided.

**October 10: Jintian Zhu (Peking University & Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Recent developments in positive mass theorem and scalar curvature problems*</span><br>
The classical Riemannian positive mass theorem states that an asymptotically flat manifold (asymptotic to the Euclidean space) with nonnegative scalar curvature has nonnegative ADM mass. In this talk, we shall make a discussion on its further generalizations for those manifolds, whose ends approach quotient spaces of Euclidean space, under an additional but necessary incompressible condition.

<span style="color:red">*Ancient solutions as singularity models of mean curvature flows*</span><br>
Mean curvature flow in extrinsic geometry is the twin of Ricci flow in intrinsic geometry. MCF is expected to have many applications in geometry and topology as the sucessful applications of Ricci flow such as  Poincare conjecture, diffeomorphism sphere theorem, smale conjecture. To have applications, the key is to understand the singularity structure.  Ancient solutions appear as the blowup limit of singularities of mean curvature flow for  capturing the behavior of flow in a spacetime neighborhood of the singularities. The most important singularities are cylindrical singularities which are expected to be generic singularity under initial data perturbation. The ancient asymptotically cylindrical flows or ancient noncollapsed flows are singularity models perturbed from the cylindrical flows. I will survey the recent developments of classification of these ancient solutions of mean curvature flows.

**September 30: Aram-Alexandre Pooladian (NYU)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Leveraging entropic regularization to approximate optimal transport maps*</span><br>
Optimal transport and its variants have gained significant interest over the past decade, primarily due to computational advancements by way of entropic regularization. In this talk, I will introduce the notions of regularized and unregularized optimal transport (for the squared-Euclidean cost, specifically), and talk about my recent work on approximating the optimal transport map, or Monge map, on the basis of entropic regularization. This is a foundational aspect of statistical optimal transport, which I will only mention briefly for the sake of motivation (joint work with Jon Niles-Weed)

**September 21 & 23: Yushan Jiang (CUNY)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory: Some Topics Related to Subsurfaces in Three Manifolds*</span><br>
Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have so many wonderful applications in different fields like geometry, topology, complex analysis, number theory and so on. One fantastic field which connects almost all such branches is hyperbolic geometry. In this talk, I will briefly introduce hyperbolic plane and space (2 & 3 dim) and some related dynamical systems (geodesic/frame flow and horocycle flow). Also I need to say a word about some terms in ergodic theory. Then I would like to talk (without proof) some famous applications in 3-manifolds theory (post-Thurston era). One is Surface Subgroup Conjecture (related to geodesic/frame flow and the famous Virtual Haken Conjecture). The other one is about the rigidity of the closures of immersed totally geodesic subsurfaces (related to unipotent group action and the famous Ratner theorems).

**September 16: Minghao Miao (Nanjing University & Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research)**<br> 
<span style="color:red">*Kahler-Einstein metric on Fano manifold*</span><br>
In this talk, I will survey some recent progress of Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, which relate certain algebro-geometric stability condition with the existence of Kahler-Einstein metric on Fano manifold. Another canonical metric, Kahler-Ricci soliton will also be discussed in a parallel setting.
