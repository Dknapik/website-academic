**October 5: Wenkui Du (UofT)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Ancient solutions as singularity models of mean curvature flows*</span><br>
Mean curvature flow in extrinsic geometry is the twin of Ricci flow in intrinsic geometry. MCF is expected to have many applications in geometry and topology as the sucessful applications of Ricci flow such as  Poincare conjecture, diffeomorphism sphere theorem, smale conjecture. To have applications, the key is to understand the singularity structure.  Ancient solutions appear as the blowup limit of singularities of mean curvature flow for  capturing the behavior of flow in a spacetime neighborhood of the singularities. The most important singularities are cylindrical singularities which are expected to be generic singularity under initial data perturbation. The ancient asymptotically cylindrical flows or ancient noncollapsed flows are singularity models perturbed from the cylindrical flows. I will survey the recent developments of classification of these ancient solutions of mean curvature flows.

<span style="color:red">*Leveraging entropic regularization to approximate optimal transport maps*</span><br>
Optimal transport and its variants have gained significant interest over the past decade, primarily due to computational advancements by way of entropic regularization. In this talk, I will introduce the notions of regularized and unregularized optimal transport (for the squared-Euclidean cost, specifically), and talk about my recent work on approximating the optimal transport map, or Monge map, on the basis of entropic regularization. This is a foundational aspect of statistical optimal transport, which I will only mention briefly for the sake of motivation (joint work with Jon Niles-Weed)

**September 21 & 23: Yushan Jiang (CUNY)**<br>
<span style="color:red">*Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory: Some Topics Related to Subsurfaces in Three Manifolds*</span><br>
Dynamical systems and ergodic theory have so many wonderful applications in different fields like geometry, topology, complex analysis, number theory and so on. One fantastic field which connects almost all such branches is hyperbolic geometry. In this talk, I will briefly introduce hyperbolic plane and space (2 & 3 dim) and some related dynamical systems (geodesic/frame flow and horocycle flow). Also I need to say a word about some terms in ergodic theory. Then I would like to talk (without proof) some famous applications in 3-manifolds theory (post-Thurston era). One is Surface Subgroup Conjecture (related to geodesic/frame flow and the famous Virtual Haken Conjecture). The other one is about the rigidity of the closures of immersed totally geodesic subsurfaces (related to unipotent group action and the famous Ratner theorems).

**September 16: Minghao Miao (Nanjing University & Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research)**<br> 
<span style="color:red">*Kahler-Einstein metric on Fano manifold*</span><br>
In this talk, I will survey some recent progress of Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, which relate certain algebro-geometric stability condition with the existence of Kahler-Einstein metric on Fano manifold. Another canonical metric, Kahler-Ricci soliton will also be discussed in a parallel setting.
