I am a first year PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/) at the University of Toronto. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics at McGill University. For my Master's degree, I explored self-affine and self-similar fractal sets, with a focus on dimension theory as well as the spectrum of the Laplacian on such sets. During this time, I was very fortunate to be jointly supervised by professors [Dmitry Jakobson](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/jakobson/) and [Linan Chen](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/lnchen/).
